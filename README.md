# FluSeason-Tableau
Using Tableau to visualize (older) influenza data through a variety of charts, graphs, and maps. 
# Introduction
* **Motivation**: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.
* **Objective**: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
* **Scope**: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
# My Role
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.
# Key Questions & Objectives
* A staffing plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without necessitating additional resources.
* Minimal instances of understaffing and overstaffing across states (a state can be considered understaffed if the staff-to-patient ratio is lower than 90% of the required ratio and overstaffed if greater than 110%).
# Data
* Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender (acquired by the CDC)
* Population data by geography (acquired by the US Census Bureau)
